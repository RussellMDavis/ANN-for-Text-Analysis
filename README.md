# ANN for Text Analysis

The power of "fake news" spreading inaccurate but damaging information has shown that there is a potential market for tools to combat this.

This project uses a neural network trained on real and false news articles to process new documents and determine whether they have a 
reasonable chance of being "fake news".  

It also demonstrates the viability of using the Twitter and Reddit APIs to parse new posts and immediately respond to them
with a comment based on the above determination.  A potential use case is for a large company, e.g. Pepsi, to monitor social media
posts for mentions of their company and rapidly begin a PR response if needed.
